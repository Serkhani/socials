## Socials 🎥

A flutter app that mimics an individual's ✨business card✨ but with a QRcode. It keeps record of all the user's profiles for various social media platforms that the user has signed up for.

## App In Use:

## Motivation 🤔

What if by a single scan, all your socials can be taken. No need to mention your phone number, instagram handle, etc. individually🤔... that was my roomates pitch by the way. I did it because it was a cool learning opportunity I could try out and I really liked his pitch :)

## Disclaimers 🚨

- This is for learning purposes. It is a friend's idea I am trying out.
- **At the moment**, this app can not scan the QRcode nor display it. It also has no user auth features.

## Installation 👩‍💻

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `cd socials`
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Run `flutter run`
5. Enjoy 😎


## Ways to improve 📈

In its current state, this application does not do what it needs to do. So, lots of improvements can be made:

  # Frontend

    [x] Showing the user's profile
    [x] Showing a page with scanned users
    [x] Adding a means for user to add other socials
    [ ] Displaying the users unique QRcode
    [ ] Adding a QRcode scanner
    [ ] Adding a page to show those that scanned the user's QRcode

  # Backend

    [ ] Adding user auth
    [ ] Adding scan notifications
    [ ] Implementing remote storage
